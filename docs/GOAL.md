# Visa Navigator - Problem Statement


## Background: What is a Case Strategy?

An O-1 visa requires applicants to demonstrate "extraordinary ability" by satisfying at least 3 of 8 criteria defined by USCIS (e.g., High Remuneration, Original Contributions, Critical Role, Membership in distinguished organizations, etc.). You can read more about the criteria [here](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-workers/o-1-visa-individuals-with-extraordinary-ability-or-achievement).

A **case strategy** is an assessment of which criteria a specific applicant is best positioned to satisfy, based on their background. For example, a founding engineer at a startup might have a case strategy targeting:

- **Critical Role** — their leadership on core product initiatives
- **High Remuneration** — above-market salary and equity
- **Original Contributions** — novel technical work with industry impact

The case strategy determines what evidence needs to be collected. **Different people with different backgrounds will have different strategies, and the onboarding experience should adapt accordingly.**


## Goal

Build an app that collects immigration case information while educating users about their visa and what "good" evidence looks like based on their experience.
